# GUC Internship System – Front-End Prototype

## Project Overview

This project is a front-end prototype of a system designed to efficiently handle all GUC internship report submissions, covering the application, enrollment, assessment, and evaluation processes. The focus of this milestone is on building a user-friendly, visually appealing web application using React and JavaScript, based entirely on front-end design principles—without any back-end or database integration.

## Objectives

- Learn and apply React and JavaScript to create a simple, effective front-end design.
- Collaborate as a team using a shared GitHub repository.
- Implement UI/UX best practices as discussed in lectures and tutorials.
- Seek and incorporate feedback from the assigned Product Manager, ensuring the design aligns with their vision.

## Requirements

- **Front-End Only:**  
  Design and implement the user interface for the GUC Internship System using React and JavaScript.
- **No Back-End/Database:**  
  Use dummy data where necessary; no real data storage or server-side programming is required.
- **UI/UX Guidelines:**  
  Follow the UI/UX principles covered in class, as well as any specific guidance provided by your Product Manager.
- **Product Manager Feedback:**  
  All design decisions and prototypes should be discussed with and approved by the assigned Product Manager to ensure alignment with their expectations.
- **Team Collaboration:**  
  Work together using GitHub to coordinate and manage code contributions effectively.
